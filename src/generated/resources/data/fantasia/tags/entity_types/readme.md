**valravn_victim_blacklist**  
Add entities here so that their baby entities cannot be targeted by valravns.  

**valravn_entity_pickup_blacklist**  
Add entities here so that tamed valravns cannot pick them up.
Note: there is an HP and hitbox size limit set in configs as well, so dragons and bosses are already excluded anyway.

**frostwork**  
Used for frostwork entities. 

**acid_immune**  
Entities with this tag will not be damaged by acid. They won't even track being inside acid at all.
